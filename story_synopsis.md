# Story synopsis

Story ideas for this mod, with branching decisions.

## Intro

Its dark. We are lying on the ground. Drunk. Surrounded with empty, and sometimes
broken bottles. The whole place looks like we spent last year drinking. The furniture
is all over the place, sometimes upside down, covered with spider-webs. It's just a very 
messy place.
We are woken up by scratching sound coming from the doors. We are going to investigate what it is.

## Outside - Village near the forest - ForestDaylight

We are standing in front of our house, which may be too magnificent of a word to describe, 
this glorified shack, a building in dire need of of reconstruction.
No one is outside. But there is something metallic lying on the ground, reflecting the 
sun. We take it. 
In our hands is small tomb-sign. We read out the name "Else Bjorresen".
our heart almost stops. Memories starts flowing back. They are only year old, but it feels
like eternity. It was supposed to be just stupid, extravagant date. She wanted to meet 
in the local cemetary at the midnight. A child's play. It turned out to be a funeral. 
we found her lying around one of the grave. Spitting lots and lost of blood.
We never find out what really happened that night.
In the place that we find the tomb-sign, theres pair of cat steps...which leads up to the 
cliff. Under the cliff, there's body of dead cat. We can pick up its body part, and 
If we are elf, we can eat it, and our head is filled up by last memories of cat, which is
greatly disturbed by the spirit that possess her. The cat follows his lead for a while, but 
than it starts fight back, until she's driven to madness.


## On the way

Its time, to do so now. From her grave, we are separated by dark forest. Its full
of wild-life.
Its like a cross-path, but instead of crosses we are going around the places, where we've 
been with Else. On the way, we might find more cat's bodies, sometimes together with
dead human bodies, like the cats were trying to run a rampage.

We are on our way to the cemetary facing our fears of opening old wounds, which tries to 
keep us from continuing further. (something like Alyson demons from DoS2 campaign).
One of the last enemies may be demon o alcohol. By defeating it, we are finally becoming sober.
If we decide to stop at these places, we may trigger some memory, like piece of dialogue, 
we had at this place. Some of these may even make us cry. We can collect our tears in the bottle.
On one of these places, we could also find a pet-pall skill and spirit vision.

## The cemetary

The cemetary is dark, the misty fog is crawling around the graves.
We can encounter some skeleton types of enemies in some parts.
We are led to the end of the cemetary. We can see mysterious mansion, which
is looming over the gravy-yard. Maybe we can even catch a glimpse of somebody
standing in the window.

### Else's tomb

We found ourselves standing over Elses Tomb for first time in a long while.
There are some flowers, with remains of rain-water in it.
We can talk to the tomb. It doesn't say anything back.
And then we hear a cat meowing, and the water from the flower disappears.
If we have the spirit vision, we may use it now. 
This will reveal spirit of the cat, leaning over the flower-pot like she wants more water.

#### PET-TALK PATH

If we have the pet talk, we can talk to the cat. We found our that she's the spirit
of Else cursed into cat, and that we need to find her body, at given position.

### Finding the well

We have to get the water. Theres water pump nearby. But its all dried up. 

#### TWIG PATH

Theres a boy around the pump, calling out what seems to be a cats name, he's having a twig
in his hand. If he approach him he threatens us with the twig, and inquires, what we did 
to his cat 'cause he can't find it. He also talks about seeing ghosts, and that he can learn
us to see them too. If we accept, and don't have it, we are getting a spirit vision.

##### SILVER TONG PATH

We can convince him that we did nothing and, that he can give us the twig, he doesn't want 
to hurt anybody, right ?

##### VILLAIN PATH

If we fail, we triggering combat. We can kill the boy to obtain the twig.

##### EXPLORER PATH

Its possible, that we can actually find similar twig around the nearby trees.

##### PICKPOCKET PATH

We can also pickpocket the boy, which gives us the twig.

We got a twig. And we can use it to lead us to the place where is the source
of water. The twig vibrates in our hands. If we are following these impulses, we are following
underground source of water.

### On the spot

We reached the place where we hear strong sound the flowing water. We can dig here, and we 
find a ladder, which brings as to the cave. 

## In the cave

We are downstairs. Water is running through the cave. If we follow it, we reach the well.
As We walk to the well, cats are running to us from different parts of the cave.
THey are wild. If only we would have something to tame them. If we talked to the Else-cat
spirit, she shows up, and cats will calm down, if not they might attack us.

### Near the well

We got to the well. It should be in the center of the cave. The wall around makes 
small flat ledge, with characteristic of the colosseum.
We see ghost of Else hanging from the well. As we are coming closer to her, the cats are 
grouping on the ledge. The start to meow.
We can ressurect Else, and as we are doing it the cats meowing turns almost into ritual chant.
For while we enjoy each others company. Her body is cold, like itf it spent long time in the 
water, but not shivering.
We learn what happened. Else asked us to meet in the cemetary, because that where 
Regimir was living - mighty wizard that was bothering Elses for some time.
And when she waited for us, he was around making advances on her. She refused.
and fought. So Regimir turned her into cat and killed her.
While she was in the cat's spirit, she was possessing cats in the neighborhood, but 
sometimes the cat rejected her spirit, and either went mad, or killed herself in some way.
But over time, Else learned to cooperate with one body - the cat named Remi.
She had to kill Remi's significant other. And when the Remi's spirit was empty
she could posses her without obstacles. here she became queen of the cats underworld.
Although they pillaged the land, it never really replaced the soft touch of her lover she 
couldn't have now. They weren't strong enough to take down the Regimir either. 
She is resurrected, and her body and mind is back, he is still having her 
soul in the soul-jar.

## The Mansion

We know that Regimir is in the mansion that is looming over the cemetary.
We need to find way in.

### PUZZLE PATH
We can go tru the cave and we get to the puzzle.(!?) which will open doors that will lead 
us to the mansion, or we can fight our way thru the main entrance.

### DIRECT PATH

If we go by the entrance, we are confronted by bunch of goons. Theres should be 
alternative path, which would give us possibility to avoid the small fight.

### CRIMINAL PATH

Depending on our status with cats, we may find a way to distract Regimir in some way.
In that case, he's going from his room in the mansion, leaving soul-jar there. If we are 
able to break some locks, we can sneak into the room by back-entrance.

### THIEF PATH

If we are good in sneaking and pick-pocketing, we could sneak to Regimir's room, and steal 
the soul-jar off him. (The only case, soul-jar is not on him, is when he leaves it somewhere)

### FIGHT

Regimir is tall thin elf. And he's VERY powerful, compared to us.

#### WARRIOR PATH

If we spent extra time fighting, and getting experience before we might defeat him.

#### MAIN PATH

But no matter how weak we are, theres always one way how to kill him. to use Else's ability,
which will insta-kill him, but ultimately kills her. 
The fight ends. We are able to retrieve soul-jar from Regimir. Else
is drawing her last breaths. We can give her soul back, so she could rest in peace, but 
thats all we can do for her. We may have our last dialog with her. This is the main outcome.

## Mansion breakdown

I would really like if the Regimir's magic could be powerful enough to rip the mansion
apart, which would have to be, blackout, and then some ruins. We could travel some distance
trough the ruins, until we find out passage. We are teleported troughs passage and we 
are coming out of some of the old broken shacks in our very village. And right here we 
collapse.

## Back at home

When we wake up, we are in our bad. But the surroundings of our house looks very different now.
Everything is cleaned upp. Theres bright daylight, an sound of birds. Depending on the outcome
theres Else on the other side of the bed.
